In the array creation vs binary op shift reduce error I set the precedence of OF
token lower than any operation. I also made it right associative cause arr of b of
c should have elements of type b of c.

In addition for other similar shift-reduce errors involving binary operators
against WHILE and FOR clauses I used %prec OF to set the precedence straight.

Only shift-reduce left is dangling else clauses and I chose to implement the
default behavior.
