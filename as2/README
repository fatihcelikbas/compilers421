In the lex definitions, i used a few shortcuts for digits, alphanumeric
characters and whitespace.

For the COMMENTs, I have a new state and for the nested comments I use a count
variable to increase and decrease to know what level of nests the lexer is in.

For strings, I have a new state as well which captures either a printable char
except \ or " (i.e. [ !#-\[\]-~]). This covers space, !, from # to [, from ] to
~. String state either captures one of these types of chars or the given escape
sequences. Later the clean() functions replaces the escape chars properly.
